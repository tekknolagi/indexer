To Do
========

1. API for modules
2. Integration with bttrack so that we have stats and can automatically add torrents
   * DHT
   * Be a tracker
3. SSL
4. Distributed storage model (or connection to other idexers)
5. Sort feature in results
6. Magnet link upload
7. Web torrent DL (HTTP or HTTPS)
8. Salt with torrent, use as login

Longterm
========

1. Self-hosting server layer to host a local cache of the DB
2. Functionality to update the local cache through more up to date peers, and to update the local caches of less up to date peers using its own
3. Bittorrent support, including a monitoring service to update the local cache with up-to-date information from currently connected bittorrent swarms
4. DHT-style decentralized and dynamic local cache updating through a p2p 'swarm', which attempts to match multiple sources of the same information to gauge authenticity
5. Seed as currency, bitcoin conversion. Pay for seeders/take commision.
